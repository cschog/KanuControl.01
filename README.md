# KanuControl.01
KanuControl is a Service app to facilitate the process of getting money for youth activities 

KanuControl is an application to facilitate the processing of grant applications at the LSB NRW. 

The new version is based on a C# app developed with SQL CE and ClickOnce under Visual Studio. 

KanuControl is now being redeveloped from scratch using SwiftUI and SQLite. The data model consists of 10 tables through which the applications (both application and billing) are implemented. KanuControl will then later generate PDF forms that will be used for official billing.

Since I am a complete SwiftUI beginner, the code will certainly be able to be optimized in many places. I am grateful for any support.

Currently I use an example of GRDB by Gwendal Rou√©. Thanks a lot for that.
